					<summary>What is Toastmasters?</summary>
					<p><a href="https://toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters</a> is an international organisation helping people across the world to improve their communication, public speaking and leadership skills.  HAC Orators is one of several Toastmasters clubs based in London, UK.</p>
					<p>Toastmasters clubs provide opportunities for members to practice their prepared and impromptu speaking skills, giving and receiving constructive feedback and leading meetings.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>What is the HAC?</summary>
					<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honourable_Artillery_Company">Honourable Artillery Company</a> (HAC) is the oldest regiment of the British Army.  It was started in 1537 by King Henry VIII.  The HAC kindly provide us with a stunning venue for our Toastmasters club.  (You do <b>not</b> need to be a member of the army or the HAC to visit or join our club.)</p>
				</details>

				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Do I need to prepare anything?</summary>
					<p>No.  As a guest you will not need to prepare anything in advance.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>What is the usual meeting agenda?</summary>
					<p>Meetings are typically structured into two parts (separated by a short break):</p>

					<ol>
						<li>prepared speeches,</li>
						<li>impromptu speeches.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>The prepared speeches (each 5&ndash;7 minutes long) are given by club members and members of other Toastmasters clubs.  These speeches can be on any topic the speaker wishes and have usually been prepared ahead of the meeting.</p>

					<p>The impromptu speeches (known as "Table Topics&reg;" within Toastmasters) are short (1&ndash;2 minutes long) improvised speeches in response to a question or prompt given by a club member.  These speeches can be given by anyone willing to participate (including guests).</p>

					<p>After each round of speeches, evaluations are given.  The evaluations provide useful feedback to the speakers and useful tips to help us all to improve.</p>

					<p>A more detailed agenda can be found under the <a href="/visit/#agenda"><i>agenda</i> section of the "visit us" page</a>.</p>
