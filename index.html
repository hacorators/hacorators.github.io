				<h1>HAC Orators Toastmasters</h1>

				Based in Finsbury, London, (but our meetings are hybrid).

				<p>
Do you want to nail that presentation at work?
<br>
Are you going to need to craft and deliver a toast or special occasion speech?

<br>
A wedding speech, after dinner speech or that crucial pitch to your financial backers?

<br>
Or have you been asked to give the dreaded five minute presentation to an interview panel?
				</p>

				<p>
If so, then welcome to HAC Orators, part of the Toastmasters organisation developing members public speaking and leadership skills. Typical meetings involve a mixture of prepared speeches, evaluations and impromptu speaking.
				</p>

				<p>
				HAC Orators is:
				</p>

					<li>A fun and friendly place to improve your public speaking skills and develop your confidence.</li>
					<li>Open to everyone â€” whether terrified of public speaking or you consider it a strength.</li>
					<li>A development programme, with different pathways, so everyone can develop their skills in the most useful way for them.</li>
					<li>An opportunity to practice both prepared and impromptu speaking.</li>
					<li>Part of the Toastmasters organisation; providing you access to quality materials and support.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				We meet on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of every month at 7pm for a 7:15pm start. Our meetings are hybrid, so you can attend either online or in person at our unique venue. Due to traditions, if attending in person, gents need to wear a jacket + tie, ladies equivalent. Photo ID will be required to enter the venue.
